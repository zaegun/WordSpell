# Word Spell Overview

This is an educational Android app to help kids with their spelling. The current implementation focuses on second grade spelling words.

In the app, the user can choose how many words they want to spell during their session. The app will generate random list of words for them to spell based on how many they want to go through.

Then the user will be shown a picture and told what word they should be spelling. At the bottom will be several buttons with letters on them. The user will use those buttons to try and spell the word correctly. They start out with 3 stars, and they lose a star for each mistake. 

After the word is spelled, they move on to the next word until the amount they chose is done. They then can see a list of their scores. They can also see all the high scores for all the words in the app.
